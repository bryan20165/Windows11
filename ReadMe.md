Hello everyone!
<br />
From the name and bio of this project, you can understand what is this project is and what it does!

About a week before I was able to write this project, Windows 11 was released by Microsoft and I was very interested in testing it.
<br />
Given that my OS is GNU/Linux and I did not want to install Windows 11 on my system! So I had to try this on virtual machine, but I told my self it might be hard for other people to do same!

So I decided to wtite a **Windows 11 Emulator** and it was finally over after a lot of effort!
